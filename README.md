C++ Particle Swarm Optimization
===============================

Single-threaded code for Assignment 2, Question 2

This is a g++ port of the source code for [Particle Swarm
Optimization](http://mnemstudio.org/particle-swarm-introduction.htm) from:
[this link](http://mnemstudio.org/particle-swarm-example-1.htm). It's
been tested with g++ 4.7.3 on Linux Mint 13.

Thanks to Haoxu for the C++ troubleshooting!
